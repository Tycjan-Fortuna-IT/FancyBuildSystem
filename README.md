# FancyBuildSystem (FBS) for Premake C++ / C#

FancyBuildSystem (FBS) is a build configuration and dependency management system designed for use with **Premake**. It simplifies the management of platform-specific and configuration-specific build settings such as preprocessor definitions, linked libraries, include directories, and more. This system is ideal for cross-platform C++ projects, allowing you to specify dependencies and build settings in a clear, modular fashion.

## Getting Started

To start using FancyBuildSystem in your **Premake** project, include it in your premake entry file like so:

```lua
include "FancyBuildSystem/FancyBuildSystem.lua"
```

## Basic Setup

FancyBuildSystem uses **scopes** to define configuration-specific, platform-specific, and global build settings. Each scope can optionally include any of the following properties:

```lua
Defines = {
    -- List of defines to add to the project
    "DEFINE1",
    "DEFINE2",
},
LibsToLink = {
    -- List of libraries to link
    "LIB1",
    "LIB2",
},
IncludeDirs = {
    -- List of include directories
    "%{wks.location}/INCLUDE_DIR1",
    "INCLUDE_DIR2",
},
LibDirs = {
    -- List of library directories
    "LIB_DIR1",
    "LIB_DIR2",
    os.getenv("LIB_DIR3") .. "/lib",
},
```

### Configuration Support

FBS supports multiple build configurations. You can define them as follows:

```lua
FBS.Configurations = FBS.Enum { "Debug", "Release", "Dist" }
```

## Defining Dependencies

You can define dependencies for different platforms or globally. This gives you flexibility to link libraries, include directories, and apply defines based on the target platform and configuration.

### Per-Platform Dependencies

In the example below, platform-specific settings are declared for both Windows and Linux. These settings apply when building on the respective platforms:

```lua
FBS.Dependencies = {
    {
        Name = "ExampleLibrary",
        Windows = {
            Defines = {
                "WIN32_DEFINE",
            },
            LibsToLink = {
                "windows_specific_lib",
            },
            IncludeDirs = {
                "%{wks.location}/vendor/WindowsLibs",
            },
            LibDirs = {
                "libs/windows",
            },
        },
        Linux = {
            Defines = {
                "LINUX_DEFINE",
            },
            LibsToLink = {
                "linux_specific_lib",
            },
            IncludeDirs = {
                "%{wks.location}/vendor/LinuxLibs",
            },
            LibDirs = {
                "libs/linux",
            },
        },
        -- This dependency only applies in the Debug configuration
        Configurations = { FBS.Configurations.Debug }
    }
}
```

### Global Dependencies

Alternatively, you can define dependencies that apply globally, regardless of the platform. This is useful for dependencies that are shared across all platforms and configurations.

```lua
FBS.Dependencies = {
    {
        Name = "CommonLibrary",
        Defines = {
            "COMMON_DEFINE",
        },
        LibsToLink = {
            "common_lib",
        },
        IncludeDirs = {
            "%{wks.location}/vendor/CommonLibs",
        },
        LibDirs = {
            "libs/common",
        },
        -- Restrict to specific configurations (optional, all configurations by default)
        Configurations = { FBS.Configurations.Debug, FBS.Configurations.Release }
    }
}
```

### Mixing Global and Platform-Specific Dependencies

You can mix global and platform-specific dependencies in the same configuration. This allows you to define common dependencies that apply to all platforms, as well as platform-specific dependencies.

```lua
FBS.Dependencies = {
    {
        Name = "CommonLibrary",
        Defines = {
            "COMMON_DEFINE",
        },
        IncludeDirs = {
            "%{wks.location}/vendor/CommonLibs",
        },
        Windows = {
            LibsToLink = {
                "windows_common_lib",
            },
        },
        Linux = {
            LibsToLink = {
                "linux_common_lib",
            },
        },
        Configurations = { FBS.Configurations.Debug, FBS.Configurations.Release }
    },
}
```

### Using local dependencies

You can also define dependencies in a local scope, which allows you to create reusable dependency definitions that can be included in multiple projects or modules. This is useful for managing complex projects with many dependencies.

It typically could include a `Dependencies.lua` file that returns all dependencies for that module. For example:

```lua
deps = {
    FBS.ImportModule("/SW.Engine/modules/SW.Common"),
    {
        Name = "GLFW",
        Defines = { "GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE" },
        IncludeDirs = { "%{wks.location}/Engine/vendor/glfw/include" },
        LibsToLink = { "GLFW" },
    },
    {
        Name = "spdlog",
        IncludeDirs = { "%{wks.location}/Engine/vendor/spdlog/include" },
    },
    {
        Name = "nvrhi",
        IncludeDirs = { "%{wks.location}/Engine/vendor/nvrhi/nvrhi/include" },
        LibsToLink = { "NVRHI" },
    }
}

return deps
```

## Using FancyBuildSystem in Your Project

Once your dependencies are defined, you can include them in your project with the following methods:

<!-- - `FBS.IncludeDependencies` - Includes dependencies for the current configuration
- `FBS.IncludeDefines` - Adds the defined preprocessor definitions for the current configuration
- `FBS.LinkDependencies` - Links the required libraries for the current configuration
- Or use the convenience method `FBS.IncludeAllDependencies` to perform all of the above in one step. -->

- `FBS.IncludeDependencies(deps, config)` - Includes dependencies for the specified configuration.
- `FBS.IncludeDefines(deps, config)` - Adds the defined preprocessor definitions for the specified configuration.
- `FBS.LinkDependencies(deps, config)` - Links the required libraries for the specified configuration.
- `FBS.IncludeAllDependencies(deps, config)` - Convenience method to perform all of the above in one step.

`deps` is the table containing your dependencies defaulting to `FBS.Dependencies`, but for the case of local dependencies, you can pass the local dependencies table.

`config` is the configuration you want to process, such as `FBS.Configurations.Debug`.

### Example Usage in a Premake Project File

Hereâ€™s how you can process the dependencies in your Premake project file for a specific configuration:

```lua
FBS.ProcessDependencies(FBS.Configurations.Debug)
```

This will include defines, link libraries, and include directories specified for the **Debug** configuration in your `FBS.Dependencies`.

### Tracy Example

```lua
{
    Name = "Tracy",
    IncludeDirs = { "%{wks.location}/Engine/vendor/tracy/tracy/public" },
    LibsToLink = { "Tracy" },
    Windows = {
        LibsToLink = { "ws2_32", "Dbghelp" },
    },
    Linux = {
        LibsToLink = { "pthread" },
    },
},
```

## Modules

Modules allow you to group dependencies together, making it easier to manage and organize dependencies related to specific features or subsystems. To use a module, simply add the following line to your dependencies table:

```lua
FBS.ImportModule("Engine/modules/Logger");
```

In the module's `Module.lua` file, define the module as follows:

```lua
return function(basePath)
    return {
        Name = "SW Logger Module",
        LibsToLink = { "Logger" },
        IncludeDirs = {
            basePath .. "/src",
            basePath .. "/vendor/spdlog/include"
        },
    }
end
```

All paths are relative to the `os.getcwd()` directory by default, but it can be changed by overwriting the `FBS.WorkspaceDirectory`.

`Transitive dependencies are not implicitly included in the module.` Therefore, you need to explicitly include any dependencies that the module requires. This allows for better control over what dependencies are included in your project.

You can use the `FBS.MergeDependencies` function to combine dependencies from multiple modules or scopes. This is useful when a module depends on another module, and you want to ensure all dependencies are included.

```lua
return function(importPath)
    return FBS.MergeDependencies(
        {
            Name = "SW.Engine",
            LibsToLink = { "SW.Engine" },
            IncludeDirs = {
                importPath .. "/src",
            },
        }, {
            FBS.ImportModule(FBS.WorkspaceDirectory .. "/SW.Engine/modules/SW.Common"),
            {
                Name = "GLFW",
                Defines = { "GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE" },
                IncludeDirs = { "%{wks.location}/Engine/vendor/glfw/include" },
                LibsToLink = { "GLFW" },
            },
        }
    )
end
```
